    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>This is the recipe from the show "Good Eats - Ham I Am."
        <br>It is a very easy recipe to complete and I will be using it for 
        <br>Christmas 2022.
    </p>

    <p>The total time is 6 hours and 15 minutes. 
        <br>The prep time is 15 minutes.
        <br>The cooking time is 6 hours.
        <br>This will yeild around 10 to 15 servings.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>1 city style (brined) ham, hock end</li>
        <li>1/4 cup brown mustard</li>
        <li>2 cups dark brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 ounce bourbon (poured into a spritz bottle</li>
        <li>2 cups crushed ginger snap cookies</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        
        <li>Heat oven to 250 degrees F.
            <br><br>
        </li>
        <li>Remove ham from bag, rinse and drain
            <br>thoroughly. Place ham, cut side down, in a
            <br>roasting pan. Using a small pairing knife or clean
            <br>utility knife set to the smallest blade setting, score
            <br>the ham from bottom to top, spiraling clockwise as 
            <br>you cut.(If you're using a pairing knife, be careful to
            <br>only cut through the skin and first few layers of fat). 
            <br>Rotate the ham after each cut so that the scores 
            <br>are no more than 2-inches across. Once you've
            <br>made it all the way around, move the knife to the 
            <br>other hand and repeat, spiraling counter clockwise.
            <br>The aim is to create a diamond pattern all over the
            <br>ham. (Don't worry too much about precision here.) 
            <br><br>
        </li>
        <li>Tent the ham with heavy duty foil, insert a
            <br>thermometer, and cook for 3 to 4 hours or
            <br>until the internal tempature at the deepest part 
            <br>of the meat registers 130 degrees F.
            <br><br>
            
        </li>
        <li>Remove and use tongs to pull away the 
            <br>diamonds of skin and any sheets of fat that 
            <br>come off with them.
            <br><br>
        </li>
        <li>Heat the ove to 350 degrees F.
            <br><br>
        </li>
            
        <li>Dab dry with paper towels, then brush on a   
            <br>liberal coat of mustard, using either a  
            <br>basting brush or a clean paint brush. (clean as in  
            <br>never-touched paint). Sprinkle on brown sugar 
            <br>packing loosely as you go until the hame is coated.
            <br>Spritz this layer lightly with bourbon, then looslely
            <br>pack on as much of the crushed cookies as you can.
            <br><br>
             
        </li>
        <li>Insert the thermometer (don't use he old 
            <br>hole) and return to the oven (uncovered).
            <br>Cook until interior tempature reaches 140 
            <br>degrees F, approximately 1 hour.
            <br><br>
            
        </li>
        <li>Let the roast rest for 1/2 hour before carving.
            <br><br>
        </li>
        <li>Cook's note: A city ham is basically any
            <br>brined ham that's packed is a plastic bag,
            <br>held in a refrigerated case and marked "ready to
            <br>cook","Partially cooked" or "ready to server". Better
            <br>city hams are also labeled "ham in natural juices" 
            <br><br>
        </li>
