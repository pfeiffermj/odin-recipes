    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        
        <li>Heat oven to 325 degrees F.
            <br><br>
        </li>
        <li>In a food processor bowl, combine crountons,
            <br>black pepper, cayenne pepper, chili powder,
            <br>and thyme. Pulse until the mixture is of a fine
            <br>texture. Place this mixture into a large bowl.
            <br>Combine the onion, carrot, garlic, and red pepper
            <br>in the food processor bowl. Pulse until the mixture
            <br>is finely chopped, but not pureed. Combine the 
            <br>vegetable mixture, ground sirloin, and ground
            <br>chuck with the bread crumb mixture. Season the
            <br>meat mixture with the kosher salt. Add the egg and
            <br>combine thoroughly, but avoid sqeezing the meat.
            <br><br>
        </li>
        <li>Pack this mixture into a 10-inch loaf pan to
            <br>mold the shape of the meatloaf. Onto a
            <br>parchment paper-lined baking sheet, turn the 
            <br>meatloaf out of the pan onto the center of the tray.
            <br>Insert a temperature probe at a 45 degree angle
            <br>into the top of the meatloaf. Avoid touching the
            <br>bottom of the tray with the probe. Set the probe for
            <br>155 degrees.
            <br><br>
                        
        </li>
        <li>Combine the catsup, cummin, Worcestershire 
            <br>sauce, hot pepper sauce and honey. Brush 
            <br>the glaze on to the meatloaf after it has been
            <br>cooking for about 10 minutes.
            <br><br>
        </li>
