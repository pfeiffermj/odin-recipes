    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Two to three days before roasting: Begin 
            <br>thawing the turkey in the refrigerator or in a 
            <br>cooler kept at 38 degrees F.
            <br><br>
        </li>
        <li>Combine the vegetable stock, salt, brown
            <br>sugar, peppercorns, allspice berries,
            <br>and candied ginger in a large stockpot over medium- 
            <br>high heat. Stir occasionally to dissolve solids around
            <br>bring to a boil. Then remove the brine from the 
            <br>heat, cool to room tempature, and refrigerate.
            <br><br>
        </li>
        <li>The night before or early on the day you'd like
            <br>to eat: Combine the brine, water and ice in 
            <br>the 5-gallon bucket. Place the thawed turkey (with 
            <br>innards removed) breast side down in brince. If 
            <br>necessary, weigh downthe bird to ensure it is fully 
            <br>immersed, cover, and refregerate or set in cool area 
            <br>for 8 to 16 hours, turning the bird once half way 
            <br>through bringing.
            <br><br>
        </li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 500 degrees F. remove 
            <br>the fird from brine and rinse inside and out 
            <br>with cold water. Discard the brine.
            <br><br>
        </li>
        <li>Place the bird on roasting rack inside a half
            <br>sheet pan and pat dry with paper towel.
            <br><br>
        </li>
        <li>Combine the apple, onion, cinnamon stick,  
            <br>and 1 cup of water in a microwave safe dish 
            <br>and microwave on high for 5 minutes. Add steeped 
            <br>aromatics to the turkey's cavity along with the 
            <br>rosemary and sage. Tuck the wings underneath the 
            <br>bird and coat the skin liberally with canola oil.
            <br><br>
        </li>
        <li>Roast the turkey on lowest level of the oven 
            <br>at 500 degrees F for 30 minutes. Insert a 
            <br>probe thermometer into the thickest part of the breast 
            <br>and reduce the oven tempature to 350 degrees
            <br>F. Set the thermometer alarm (if available) to 161
            <br>degrees F. A 14 to 16 pound bird should require a 
            <br>total of 2 to 2 1/2 hours of roasting. Let the turkey
            <br>rest, loosely covered with foil or a large mixing bowl
            <br>for 15 minutes before carving. 
            <br><br>
